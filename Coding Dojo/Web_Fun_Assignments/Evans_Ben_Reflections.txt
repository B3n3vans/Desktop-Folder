How have you noticed your bootcamp knowledge grow or change during Programming Basics?

So far I have noticed a significant change in what I know and understand about coding. I've learned how computers think and read lines of code.
I've learned how to do math in the language of the computer, and I have been come a better typewriter on my keyboard because of repetition from the work.

How have you noticed your approach to learning change throughout Programming Basics?

I have noticed a change in my approach and it is simply because I am motivated and excited for the curriculum and the opportunities that passing this bootcamp may bring.

What do you consider your "Mistake of the Week," which was a failure you learned from during Programming Basics?

My failure of the week was figuring out that every single character that is written in code is important and has meaning. There were several times where I would glance
over lines of code not noticing that in stead of i++ it was now i+=2 which will completely change the output of a for loop. Moving forward I will ensure that I pay close 
attention to every bit of information that is provided.
